    in_short: "I see the Web as a tool that can shape an open and decentralized society. The Web being by nature virtual, I see the library as the tool that connects the Web to the physical world. Together, these two tools make it possible to share everyone's knowledge for all. At the same time, I am interested in the new shared governance tools and commons economy that will soon change our operating methods. I hope one day to be able to live the utopia of a free society, based on the peer-to-peer economy, made up of small local communities linked by the web and fraternal bonds."

  title: Libraries for the 21st century
  description: The digitalization of society, the rapid social and economic changes of the twenty-first century are making culture, knowledge and information increasingly essential production resources. In order to enable citizens to contribute, innovate and live serenely in the knowledge and information society, it is necessary to give it the necessary tools. The library is that toolbox! So let us ensure that the library reinvents itself to meet the challenges ahead.

profile:
  title: One CV, two profiles
  description: "My visits to different libraries, archives and museums, a curiosity for trends and innovations, discussions and thousands of hours spent on the web have allowed me to bring out many ideas and models adapted to the field.<br/>I am passionate about this way of doing things: observing, exchanging, questioning, doubting, searching, gathering, designing and applying. Wherever I go, this process accompanies me in order to create new ideas or new models. It is with this in mind that I am passionate about web technologies and commons economy. Above all, I think that the library is at the heart of the societal model that allows for the transition to the commons economy."
